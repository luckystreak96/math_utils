# Math Utils

Various math applets for game programming
So far:
    -Matrix manipulation program
    -Vertex and index creation and visualisation program

TODO for the visualisation program:
    -Make pressing enter again call a method to parse the buffer
        +So it'll add the indices :)
    -Make a little more intuitive?
